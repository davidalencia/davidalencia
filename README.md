### Hi!

This is my profile

I'm currently studying Computer Science @UNAM.
I also aspire to become a science communicator. I am currently using [math animations](https://github.com/davidalencia/math_animations) and tiktok [@davidalencia](https://www.tiktok.com/@mybrainissoftandwet) to help me with that.

I have experience doing web development. With frontend frameworks like Vue and React, and backend framework like Express and Loopback.

My favourite languages are Julia and Javascript.
